## Overview and Instructions for Andrew Birnbaum Independent Study

## Data
- Too big for github
- Sample anatomicals are [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p8xonn1wj6u3zmaomz2s6/AILrK4NfFAFUl1OhFIjGl50?rlkey=f4v4twth7uolnzitnte7xc3nt&dl=0)

## High-level overview
- Instead of going after stochastic thermodynamics, we are pivoting into extending the analysis of BOLD functional connectivity (FC) that was published at this year's EMBC conference [paper](./EMBS_conference_paper.pdf)
- We need to extend the paper as described in this [email](./email_invitation.rtf)
- Your job is to conduct the additional analyses of the data that will form the bulk of the new results/analyses that they are asking for
- A jupyter notebook that recreates the main figures in the manuscript is [here](./code/generate_fc_figures.ipynb) -- please familiarize yourself with this


## Suggestions for new analyses (generated by GPT-5)

*You should start with (A), as it is an anatomical MRI processing exercise*

A. Ultrasound targeting & “dose–response” modeling

Right now targeting is described qualitatively. Turn it into a quantitative modeling section:
	1.	For each subject:
        - Compute skull-to-target path length, incidence angle, etc.
        - Use a simple layered medium or (if you can) k-Wave/Sim4Life-style simulation to estimate in situ pressure/Ispta at sgACC.
        - Derive a per-subject dose metric (e.g., estimated in situ Ispta or normalized pressure at sgACC).
	2.	Correlate dose with:
        - change in sgACC global FC (during, post)
        - % of strengthened sgACC edges
        - slope of dFC increase in the post period

If we could find a monotonic relationship, even trend-level, it would be gold.

B. Network-level specificity instead of “lots of edges went up”

Right now you show histograms and proportions of strengthened edges.
	1.	Canonical network analysis
        - Assign ROIs to DMN, salience, limbic, FPN, etc.
        - For each network:
            - sgACC-to-network FC change (active vs sham, during & post).
            - Ask: is sgACC preferentially integrating into limbic/DMN/affective control circuits vs everything?
	2.	Graph-theoretic metrics
        - Compute, for sgACC:
            - degree/strength, participation coefficient, within- vs between-network connectivity, eigenvector centrality.
            - Pre vs during vs post, active vs sham.
        - Show sgACC becomes more integrative hub-like after tFUS (or more embedded in specific networks).
	3.	Network-Based Statistic (NBS) or FDR-controlled edgewise maps
        - Identify a connected subnetwork of edges significantly modulated by active vs sham.
        - Visualize as a network centered on sgACC, not just a bar.


C. Proper temporal dynamics: from “slow increase” to state/trajectory model

Your EMBC version has sliding-window dFC; you note a slow increase.  ￼ Let’s get more serious:
	1.	Event-locked dFC to each sonication
        - For each of the 5 sonications, compute sgACC–whole-brain FC in windows before/after.
        - Average across events.
        - Test for cumulative ramping (e.g., linear mixed model: FC ~ sonication_index × condition).
	2.	State-based analysis
        - Use simple k-means or HMM on dFC to define a few connectivity “states”.
        - Test whether active tFUS increases occupancy of high-sgACC-integration states vs sham, especially post.
	3.	Simple plasticity-like modeling
        - Fit an exponential or linear-growth + decay model to sgACC global FC over time.
        - Compare τ parameters between active and sham; interpret as putative synaptic/plasticity timescale.

D. Effective connectivity: directional story (selective, not overkill)

You don’t need a monstrous DCM paper; a focused effective connectivity analysis on a small ROI set is enough:
	1.	Choose a priori nodes:
        - sgACC, mPFC, amygdala, PCC, ventral striatum / thalamus (keep it lean).
	2.	Use:
        - PPI: is the sgACC “contextual coupling” to these regions strengthened specifically during active tFUS?
        - Or a small-signal spectral DCM model comparing baseline vs post, active vs sham.

Even a modest result like “sgACC → dmPFC influence increases post-tFUS in active but not sham” becomes powerful mechanistic content, especially next to Yaakub/Chou/Lord etc. showing region- and protocol-specific effects.  ￼

E. Control & robustness analyses (boring but absolutely essential)

These are low-risk/high-value and add substantial new methods text:
	1.	Motion & physiological confounds
        - Show FD, DVARS, scrubbed volumes are matched across conditions/segments.
        - Re-run FC with aggressive motion/CompCor regression; show results hold.
	2.	Global signal / nuisance robustness
        - Repeat key analyses:
        - with and without global signal regression,
        - using partial correlations controlling for global signal.
        - If effects survive → strong claim of non-artifactual neuromodulation.
	3.	Permutation / bootstrap
        - Subject-label or condition-label permutations to estimate null distribution of sgACC FC change.
        - Edgewise/NBS corrections to prove effects aren’t p-hacked.
	4.	Reliability across runs
        - If feasible, show consistency of sgACC modulation across sonications within individuals.

F. Individual differences + relevance to depression circuitry

Leverage what’s special about sgACC:
	1.	Baseline-dependent effects
        - Test whether subjects with lower baseline sgACC FC show larger increases (a “normalization”-like pattern reminiscent of TRD connectivity findings).  ￼
	2.	Relate to structural factors
        - Distance to focus / skull density ratio vs FC effect (ties back to dose modeling).
	3.	Translational bridge paragraph
        - Explicitly map your modulation pattern onto known sgACC abnormalities in depression and emerging sgACC-tFUS clinical work.  ￼
