Introduce the scientific motivation, prior work on low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) neuromodulation, and the translational significance for neuropsychiatric disorders. Clearly state the open question this manuscript addresses and outline the contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantify baseline resting-state connectivity patterns in the sgACC and distributed networks.
    \item Model acute changes in functional connectivity induced by FUS stimulation.
    \item Provide mechanistic interpretation that links FUS dose, targeting accuracy, and network-level responses.
\end{itemize}
Conclude with a roadmap of the paper.
